# SWEAGLE Integration to ServiceNow

DESCRIPTION

SWEAGLE for Service Now improves realtime decision making for incident and change managers while also providing CI/CD pipeline awareness for Operation's teams.  The growing volume of configuration data related to micro-services, cloud provisioning and containers, combined with the ephemeral nature of cloud computing makes it impractical to store such data in the CMDB.  Sweagle is the secure, agnostic repository for voluminous, dynamic, and sensitive configuration data.  Sweagle also provides a comprehensive test platform for validating configuration changes as they move through the CI/CD pipeline.   

This application provides the following integrations with the CMDB:

- Retrieve config data for CMDB objects from within ServiceNow UI for current and past versions

- Provide Config Data Validation Reports for CIs from within ServiceNow Change Request or dependency maps

- Retrieve Diff-Compare report for different snapshots of a CI
