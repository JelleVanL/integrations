# Sweagle Slackbot Starter Kit using Botkit and Glitch

This repo contains everything you need to get started building a Sweagle Slack bot.
It uses source from  [Botkit](https://botkit.ai) and [Botkit Studio](https://botkit.ai).
It is expected to be deployed on glitch (https://glitch.com/botkit) by default.

Please, before using it, understand fundamentals of Slack applications and bots here:
https://api.slack.com/slack-apps
https://api.slack.com/bot-users

Then, you can use starter here to build your own slack bot:

Finally, inspire yourself from Sweagle code included in bot.js from this project to add Sweagle integration to your bot.
